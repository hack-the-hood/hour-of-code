Here are a few resources

If you are starting from not understanding any code and you would like to prepare to become a software developer, I would start with the code academy. The code academy is a great learning resource for getting started with a new language. You can go from not understanding anything about syntax and data structure to beginning to solve problems in the language of choice. 

1. [code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn)

  - Learn Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  
  These are the fundamental building blocks of becoming a front end web developer, and if you go through these tracks, you should be ready  to apply for a bootcamp. If you have questions about any of the concepts being introduced in the learning modules search CS50 (topic-name) in youtube and check out a short on the topic.
  
2A. [khan academy](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=khan+academy+computer+programming&*)

This is a wonderful resource to use after the code academy fundamentals. You will start to understand how the pieces play together which is really important for being able to build web applications.

2B. [Khan Academy Breakdown](https://github.com/hack-the-hood/hour-of-code/blob/master/week2/Monday/module1.md)

I created a document for you to understand the khan academy learning objectives getting started with HTML and CSS. Understanding layout is important but understanding javascript is more important for getting admitted to a bootcamp, it will all come together and the khan academy computer programming tracks will take you through it. I would start with the drawing and animation track and then continue on, I believe they are ordered in sequence so once you complete one learning objective they will suggest you move on to the next which builds upon your understanding. There are many examples here of the ways in which HTML-CSS-JS play together.

3. [learn command line](https://www.udacity.com/course/linux-command-line-basics--ud595)

If you are going to continue working with a chromebook you can use caret and google drive for storage of your documents, but get familiar with cloud9 IDE because you can not be a developer without understanding the command line.

4. [eloquent javascript written by Hack Reactor](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

Now that you know some javascript and you have built a few things with it lets get under the hood. Read up to at least chapter 5. Pace yourself this may take a few weeks, if you are just starting to digest computer science textbooks. Take your time and understand the material.

5. [code school javascript roadtrip](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/javascript-road-trip-part-1)

This is a fun tutorial about javascript and understanding the language. The first portion is free but we are working on getting a Hack The Hood Account for you all to use.

6. [repl](https://repl.it/languages/javascript)

Online text editor which allows you to run javascript code and view the outputs.

7. [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com)

This is a step by step breakdown of front end development concepts. Check it out and start to play around with the syntax. There is about 2100 hours of information here so pace yourself.

8. [front end masters](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=front+end+masters&*)

Here is your hidden gem. If you do not have an account activation code for a year subscription for free, please let me know and I will get that to you. There are so many courses avaiable here for you to understand and work through. If you would like to continue learning front end development, tackle the javascript courses first and then learn a framework. I would start with React, maybe angular.

9. [GA WDI schedule](https://github.com/sf-wdi-gaia/schedule-32)

If you are thinking about entering a bootcamp check out the entire GA curriculum on github, even go through the exercises.

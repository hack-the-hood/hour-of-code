I would suggest that you start with the command line, because you wont get far as a developer without it.
The you could start by working through HTML + CSS tracks on code academy and khan academy. Then you could start working through the free code amp
website and see how far you can get. If you get through all of that. Tackle javascript. There is a textbook (eloquent javascript written by Hack Reactor)[http://eloquentjavascript.net/]
